Hi,there!

This is the instruction on how to compile and run the assignment:

For client(FYI: Professor said that we can use either --ttl or -p... I chose -p for the flag):
	python client.py [optional flag -p] [the site you wanna access] [port num]

For server:
	python server.py [port num]


Thank for reading! Have a good one :D
