Hi,there!

This is the instruction on how to compile and run the assignment:

For client(FYI: Professor said that we can use either --ttl or -p... I chose --ttl for the flag):
	python client.py [optional flag --ttl] [the site you wanna access] [port num]

For server:
	python server.py [port num]

BTW,
	WPI server is not very stable in accessing. So sometimes the client fails to fetch the data from ccc.wpi.edu:[port]/TMDG.html 
	You can either try to access it several times(sometimes it succeeds) or host the server side on localhost. 
	I highly recomment to look at the ccc.wpi.edu:[port]/TMDG.html in a browser! It is beautiful!


Thank for reading! Have a good one :D
